##### This is a Deep Neural Network created as a part of "Mathematics for Machine Learning" course final project at Halmstad University. This MLP is directly taken from the course, meaning this project is provided as-is. 

### Improvements will no longer be made on this project.



# Instructions

Use Start.ipynb to interact, manage, run and test the Neural Network. 

`neuralnetwork.py` is the main file and class for all logic. Other `.py` files are smaller components used to run the MLP algorithm.
